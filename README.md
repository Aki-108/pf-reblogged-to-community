# pf-reblogged-to-community
This is an extension to [pillowfort.social](https://www.pillowfort.social/). It shows the communities a post has been reblogged to.

## installation
1. If you don't already have it, you'll need to install the browser extension Tampermonkey (or a similar one).
2. Click on the Tampermonkey icon in the top right of your browser and choose to create a new userscript.
3. Delete everything in the new script and past everything from the reblogged-to-community main.js file.
4. Save with Ctrl+S or through the menus.

Note: The tab with the post has to be in the foreground for the extension to load correctly. Opening a tab in the background won't work.
